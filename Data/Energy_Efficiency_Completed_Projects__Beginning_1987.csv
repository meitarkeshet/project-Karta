The Micro grid will provide power and possibly heat to the Corrections/Public Safety buildings of the Westchester County Complex and approximately 5 building on the Westchester Community College campus.  NY Prize is a three-stage competition. During Stage 1, competitively selected communities receive funding to conduct engineering assessments that evaluate the feasibility of installing and operating a community microgrid at a proposed site in New York State. The Westchester Community College and Westchester County Valhalla Campus are centrally located in one of New York’s most populous counties. The county, with two shorelines — one on the Hudson River and the other on the Long Island Sound — is especially susceptible to floods and power outages during an extreme weather event such as Hurricane Sandy. The County’s First Responder capabilities, in time of crisis, are also critical to New York City because of their strategic geographic location. The proposed microgrid would explore a mix of distributed energy resources such as solar and combined heat and power applications, along with battery storage. Partners: Con Edison, Entecco, Eaton, Kheops, KeyBank, TAG Mechanical, and New York Power Authority."

The in-depth Study is to evaluate options at the Wards Island WPCP for reliable and efficient emergency generators, boilers, and an electric and heat cogeneration facility that maximizes the use of anaerobic digester gas (ADG) and minimizes the use of natural gas and fuel oil.         The Study is aimed at improving the reliability of heat and electricity supply, and reducing the City?s greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of PlaNYC.  The Study will include, but not be limited to, evaluations of existing and planned heating boilers and emergency power generation systems and recommend future systems that economically complement the cogeneration system and meet the plant?s needs for heating and emergency power. The DEP is currently planning investments including the replacement of emergency generators and the installation of a new boiler plant. At a minimum, the Study will address how the DEP can capitalize on these needs with an integrated cogeneration system that serves both purposes, and will include a comparison of these planned investments versus a cogeneration system; other alternatives may also be explored."

ECM-3  Replacement of Steam Traps The steam traps in the facility are beyond their useful life and a significant amount of them have failed in ether the open or closed position. Traps that are open allow energy to escape to the atmosphere with getting full benefit of that energy. Those that fail closed cause areas to be uncomfortable since energy is not transferred and supplemental means are used by individual users (ie. small electric heaters). ECM-4 Provide Windows in Auditorium The existing windows are missing glass and have been shuttered with plywood. This greatly increases outside air infiltration, increasing the overall building heating load. ECM-5 Provide Direct Digital Controls (DDC) Control Energy will be saved by installing DDC controls to take advantage of time-of-day comfort controls and control of exhaust fans so that the building is not being conditioned when not in use by facility personnel. ECM-6 Replace Heating and Ventilating Units The existing units are in poor condition and are not in operation. Since providing ventilation air is a New York City code requirement, the installation and operation of new H&V units is recommended despite the fact that this will result in greater energy consumption."

Lighting Upgrades A lighting survey of the entire building was performed for potential lighting upgrades that could be implemented to reduce energy consumption and provide savings. Fluorescent fixtures supply the majority of lighting in the interior portions of the building. The majority of the fluorescent fixtures were recently changed to 3-bulb and 4-bulb T-8 fixtures with several floors still containing T-12 fluorescent fixtures with magnetic ballasts. These fixtures will be retrofitted with 2-bulb T-8 fixtures with electronic ballast to reduce energy. ECM task 2. Motor and VFD Upgrades A motor survey was performed, and it was found that some motors had low efficiencies. Motors over 5-horsepower with low efficiencies will be changed out with higher efficiency motors. Also, the fan motors on several AHU s were found to be operating at a constant  speed and are thus candidates for VFD s. ECM task 3. BMS and Controls Upgrade + AHU Optimization. Currently, the facility does not have a primary system of controls for the chiller plant and AHU s in the facility. The AHUs controls and accessories will be upgraded along with a BMS upgrade that will tie in all the AHU s in the facility and the chiller plant. The BMS will implement setback scheduling for the equipment during unoccupied hours. Scheduling will include off hours temperature set back and staging of units. ECM task 4. CHW System Optimization. The secondary chilled water distribution pumps have variable speed drives on a constant flow system. The AHU s have three-way valves on the chilled water coils that do not allow the VFDs controls to vary the flow of the system. The pumps will be retro-commissioned to operate with the VFD maintaining the system pressure differential as designed by replacing all three-way valves with two-way control valves. ECM task 5: Steam Trap Replacements. There are approximately 150 steam traps in the facility. A steam trap has an average useful life of 3-5 years. A complete survey of the steam traps will be performed in order to determine those that are in need of replacement. ECM task 6: Supplemental AC Unit Replacements. There are a total of 22 supplemental air conditioner units in the building s data centers, telephone room, UPS room, and various other critical locations. These are a mixture of air and water cooled units. These units are in place because the central HVAC system does not provide cooling to these locations. Computer rooms and other critical equipment require special space conditioning to guarantee cooling of the space. Out of the 22 units, 8 were found to be nearing the end of their lifetime and were running inefficiently. This project will be replacing 8 air conditioner units. Newer computer room air conditioners are about 20% more efficient than older units whether water or air cooled."

Micro Steam Turbines Installation. Sheridan Avenue Steam Plant has a deaerator that requires constant volume of 8,000 lbs/hr of steam. The plant has a pressure reducing station that reduces the pressure of the steam from 250 psi to 10 psi. Health Services Center has a pressure reducing station as well that serves steam sterilization heat exchangers. The steam pressure is reduced from 250 psi to 30 psi at a pressure reducing station. Installation of a 275 kW Micro Steam turbine generator in the Sheridan Steam Plant and Health Services Center will provide additional electricity generation from pressure reducing processes. These turbines will be piped in parallel with the pressure reducing station (PRV). In normal operation the steam will flow through the turbine generating electricity and will leave the turbine at the set pressure needed for the final application. When electricity demand is low or the turbine is off, the steam will flow through the pressure reducing station. The electric interconnect will be coordinated with the local utility, the National Grid. The estimated construction cost is $1,802,000 and estimated annual energy cost savings is $193,500. 2. Hydro Turbine Installation. The condenser water return from the chiller plant is piped in a tunnel to a storm water system discharging to the river. Installation of hydro turbine in the return water piping will capture the kinetic energy in the return water flow. A bypass piping will also be installed to keep the water flow when the turbine is in service or electric demand is low. The estimated construction cost is $5,940,000 and estimated annual energy cost savings is $399,900."

Additionally, the unit sends back a status every 30 seconds to tell the operator if the unit is working or not.  If the element has failed, a maintainer can be sent to the location to make repairs before a freeze up, allowing for better deployment of maintenance personnel.  Since the units will now run an average of 500-700  hours per season instead of  4300 hours, the elements will last longer reducing maintenance costs as well.  In this program, the energy savings alone will fund the project with simple paybacks estimated at 6 years.  We will be providing the materials and oversight throughout the project.

The scope includes the installation of a new low pressure steam central boiler plant, and the replacement of the high-pressure piping and valves, with low-pressure piping and equipment. A low pressure (LP) steam plant, rated at 15 psig, allows for the majority of the plant s HVAC equipment to remain in service. Currently, high pressure steam is distributed throughout the facility through a number of distribution tunnels and buried conduit piping. At each building, the high pressure steam must pass through a pressure reducing valve (PRV) in order to be reduced to a pressure equal to or less than that which is characteristic of a LP boiler plant. Under this option, all the piping and valves need to be replaced, since it is a changeover from a high pressure steam system to a low-pressure steam. Low-pressure steam requires new and larger piping, which cannot be serviced with the existing piping infrastructure."

These changes to the plant distribution system are required in order to allow the plant to participate in the PLM Program. The distribution system as it exists now does not allow the plant to  split load  between the Con Edison system and the local generation. The plant is required to completely isolate itself from the Con Ed system before the local generation can carry load. The new design allows the plant to isolate each of the three distribution buses from Con Edison and connect the plant generators to the isolated bus section to carry load while the plant is still connected to the Con Ed system.

The current CUNY Law facility configuration is comprised of two different roof elevations in addition to four (4) very large roof top AC units with direct distribution duct work, totaling 123,130 Square Feet. These rooftop AC units provide heating as well as cooling. There are also two (2) chillers in the basement with R 22 refrigerants that will be replaced with environmentally friendly R 134A refrigerant. All of the rooftop units and the two chillers are past their useful life and are overdue for replacement. Our analysis determined that by centralizing the chiller plant and the air handling fan units, the HVAC heating and cooling will yield significant energy savings and reduce the maintenance cost of operations. The reconfiguration of the air handling system will require that a fan mechanical room be strategically located to minimize the modifications to the existing discharge locations. The new location for the fan mechanical room would minimize energy loses in distribution runs, while maintaining the lowest possible constructability cost. The optimal location for the fan mechanical room would be directly above where three (3) of the four (4) existing rooftop AC units are currently located, which is the lower roof elevation. The lower roof area is in the CUNY Master Plan for expansion and would preclude us from utilizing the lower roof area for the fan mechanical room. We would be able to locate the fan mechanical room one story above the lower roof area by building an energy efficient structure that would support the fan mechanical room equipment and distribution ductwork. This configuration would still provide the shortest duct runs to the existing air distribution to the lower floor areas. The shell structure will act as the structural dunnage to support the fan mechanical room and will also facilitate the immediate need of protection from the environment with the highest thermal insulating performance. The centralized Chiller plant with a centralized fan mechanical room and Building Management System expansion will yield a total of $176,000 in energy savings which equates to 1,000 Mega Watt Hours annually. The new central chiller plant will be designed and erected with LEED Credits in mind. This will include energy efficient chillers, air handling units and pumps. The composite wall and roof of the addition will be above industry standards with respect to insulation and composition. Efficient windows and caulking will be used to create a weather tight building with minimal heating and cooling losses. A Building Management System (BMS) as well as Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) will also promote efficiency by ensuring a minimal amount of energy use. Project Scope of Work:   Two 250ton centrifugal chillers w/VFD   One additional CW and CHW pump set   One new Cooling tower   New CW piping   Extension piping for CHW and Steam to AHU s   New AHU s w/ heat and CHW coils   BMS system   VFD drives on pumps and fan drives   New fan mechanical room   High efficiency wall composite   Structural Steel and framing steel   Concrete floor slabs   Aluminum curtain wall   HVAC rough-in   Roofing (best thermal performance)   All design and management fees"

Where applicable, occupancy sensors should be installed to turn lights off automatically. Traffic signals should be upgraded to LED technologies where ever feasible. Standard-efficiency motors should be replaced with new, premium-efficiency motors where practical. Variable-frequency drives should be installed to reduce the volume of air movement when higher flow rates are not required. Air flow to specific areas should be regulated by thermostatically controlled dampers. Upgrade the city s energy management systems to include economizer controls, chilled water bypass, timer controls, and ventilation controls. The existing system should be optimized based on the buildings  occupancy and schedules. Install caulking, weatherstripping, and door sweeps to seal up gaps in the existing building s envelopes. Sealing the gaps will prevent unconditioned outside air from entering the building as well as prevent conditioned inside air from leaving the building. Replace leaking or clogged how water coils in the ventilation system. The coil replacement will improve comfort levels within the facilities as well as reduce heating energy costs. Seal the construction joint between the garage and the maintenance bay. Sealing this joint will prevent exhaust fumes form traversing from the garage into the maintenance area. Install a dehumidifier to the City Hall penthouse HVAC unit. The dehumidifier will result in improved indoor air quality and improved occupant comfort at lower thermostatic set points. Address the chilled water leak-by at City Hall. Either a defective valve or poor EMS control is allowing chilled water to leak into how water piping during the heating season.

The Plant is located along the Hudson River and runs the entire length from 135th Street to 125th Street and encompasses the entire area from the Westside highway to the river bank. The Plant is subterranean to a Park that was constructed on what is the roof of the plant. The waste water process is complex. One of the components needed to process the sewage is hot water and heat. For the North River Plant this hot water and heat is provided by 4 boilers all physically located in one boiler room. All hot water and heat needed to treat the sewage and to provide space heating to this 26 acre complex is distributed by a hot water distribution piping system. This project is limited to the replacement of these boilers, the installation of a control system to maintain proper heating temperatures, the hot-water distribution piping, and the motors used to move hot water to and from the various plant processes. Boiler Plant The existing boilers in the North River Plant have come to the end of their useful life due to thermal stress and corrosion. This was caused by the leaks in the distribution piping that has allowed cold water to enter into the hot boilers, cracking them. In addition, since the plant losses 30,000 gallons of hot water per day water treatment that is typically done for these boilers cannot be done causing severe corrosion. The extensive repairs and corrosion has significantly reduced the operating efficiency of the boilers to the point at which they can now be replaced with a new boiler system that will provide an efficiency gain of over 20%. The new boiler plant will utilize state of the art high efficient boilers and burners significantly reducing fuel costs and also will be protected from thermal shock. Last, the current plant condition does not comply with NYC code and safety requirements. Controls The current hot water control system is non-functional. This condition results in operating the hot water system uncontrolled and significantly overheating all areas of the plant. Installing the new control system will provide significant energy efficiency savings by allowing the very tight control of process and space heating. Piping From an energy efficiency standpoint, it is critical to stop the hot water pipe leaks and install the valves needed to put the hot process water where it is needed. The current pipe leaks are causing large amounts of hot water to be wasted daily (approximately 30,000 gallons) and the same amount must be reheated for the required make-up water. This water leaking is a prime reason why the North River boilers are cracking and being subjected to severe corrosion. Permanently repairing this piping system will result in significant energy savings.eIn order to perform the pipe repairs, the entire piping system must be completely drained of all the hot water (1.2 million gallons of hot water annually) which must be refilled and reheated after the repair. All replacement piping will be fully insulated which will significantly reduce energy losses and improve the overall efficiency of the system. Motors Replacement of the existing pump motors will result in an improvement in the installed motor efficiencies for the existing pumps. Existing pumps with standard efficiency motors will be replaced with pumps using high efficiency motors. Based on these improvements, there will be additional savings associated with the motor replacement. Renewable Energy Project Turbine A small turbine will take advantage of gravity flow of wastewater to generate additional electricity for the plant. The new boiler plant will consist of (4) low pressure steam boilers with low Nox burners, heat exchangers, (4) 1000 gpm primary pumps with variable frequency drives, new fuel lines for oil, gas and digester gas, automatic water chemistry system and control system integration for operator control room interface. The new piping system will consist 25,000 feet of new welded piping including new valves, piping supports, insulation, piping instrumentation and an automatic water chemistry system. Inoperable secondary plant systems will also be replaced with new efficient equipment which includes hot water pumps, motors, control valves and heat exchangers. The scope of work also includes the installation of a water turbine in the North end of the secondary influent channel with a generating capacity of 33 Kw to power local odor control fans."
